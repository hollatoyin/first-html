  <h1>Imperfection</h1>
  <p class="style1 paragraph">
    If I were to describe myself, I would say I am one insecure young woman. I thrive in fear, I have anxiety issue, I
    feel I am never enough. I know my fears yet I do nothing to overcome them. If I were to die from a self-inflicted
    death, I am certain it will be an anxiety related death.
  </p>
  <h1 class="custom-header">Imperfection</h1>
  <p class="style1 p2">
    My childhood was really much uneventful, I do not remember in details of what my life had been like prior to
    10years of age, it feels like that was when I was just born
  </p>
  <h1 class="custom-header"> Imperfection</h1>
  <p class="custom p1"> Growing up I never did really had a father-daughter relationship and that was because my father
    stays in a different town, he only comes to town once a while and on holidays we’d go visiting. I always looked
    forward to him coming home because that’s the only family time we have.
    Some years later, my father started to live with us due to a sickness and he needs proper medical care which was
    only accessible in the city I was in, it was then I started to have a personal relationship with him; he literally
    became my best friend. He was a convalescent at that time who needs cares, I’d care and cook for him, he was a
    picky eater lol.
    I love to listen to him relieve memories of his feat, his spiritual and life journey. I could talk to him for
    hours and not get bored .I was in awe, I mean how can someone be so great?
